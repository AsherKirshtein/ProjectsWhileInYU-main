Seratonin Highs

I wrote a song about you last night
And I can't lie
It's still in my head
I remember the hook was about our lives
Serotonin highs
That haven't happened yet
I ain't nothin' but a boy from the 415
She ain't nothin' but a girl who got hope in her eyes
I ain't sayin' I got everything you need but
I'll be on your team
By your side
When you sleep at night
Wait up, you being serious?
Are you for real?
I guess I forgot exactly how it feels
I rest my head
Slowly go to bed but
Soon as I'm up
I run to you
You got me skipping meals
I been falling under
Your disguise
Nothin' like I ever seen
I don't wanna wonder
Wanna wonder
I wrote a song about you last night
And I can't lie
It's still in my head
I remember the hook was about our lives
Serotonin highs
That haven't happened yet
And it goes like
Serotonin highs all up in my body
She just call me daddy
Oh she actin' kinda naughty
I'm a player most of time
But now I love it when she call me
Tell me all about her day
And time without her feeling foggy
Singin la la la
In my car
On my way to you
Play this song
Think of us
And what we can do
Life can feel like a trip
But with me and you
We can make it work
I know me and you quite the special two
I been falling under
Your disguise
Nothin' like I ever seen
I don't wanna wonder
You decide if you wanna stick with me
I been falling under
Your disguise
Nothin' like I ever seen
I don't wanna wonder
Wanna wonder
I wrote a song about you last night
And I can't lie
It's still in my head
I remember the hook was about our lives
Serotonin highs
That haven't happened yet
And it goes like
And it goes like
